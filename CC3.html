        Seymour Duncan Blackouts represent the pinnacle in active guitar pickup technology. In his<br>
        relentless quest for the ultimate tone, Mick Thomson of the metal band Slipknot asked Seymour<br>
        Duncan for even tighter bottom and more searing top end cut, so Seymour Duncan delivered with the<br>
        EMTY, a pulverizing addition to their Blackouts line<br>

        Put mine in my Schecter Omen-6. I tune to E, or maybe a step down. Use 9 gauge D'Addario NYXL<br>
        strings. It suits metal just fine. You can't really appreciate it until you tweak with you amp<br>
        settings, then you can really bring out some awesome sounds out of it. Its very bright, squeals<br>
        are easy as hell with it. Really cuts through. Though without the tweaking, can be really thin.<br>
        Treble bleed mod was awesome for it. Don't really feel it applies to other genres easily (this is<br>
        where the treble bleed helps out). Leads slice right through, Van Halen is fun as hell to play with<br>
        this pup. You won't sound like Dimebag unless you got the rest of the gear. For people like me who<br>
        tend to like brighter pickups, and listen to any older metal, you'll be pretty satisfied.<br>
