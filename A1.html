    <p>
    The String winder and cutter is exactly what it sounds like, a useful tool to not only <br>
    wind your strings, but also cut them once you are finished restringing. Such a useful <br>
    is very sought after and is very handy in a guitarists toolkit.<br>

    As a first time use of a string winder, I had always thought they were merely a vanity <br>
    item and were unnecessary for changing strings. However, now that I am using them, I realize<br>
    how valuable and great they are. Now I no longer cut my cheeks on my headstock!
