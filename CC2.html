        Crunchy pick attack, scooped mids, and just the right amount of saturation are what this pickup<br>
        is all about. Dime wanted his signature humbucker to have a thick crunch that sags just a little when<br>
        you really lay into it. Combine that with a full, tight, low end response, a ceramic magnet, with<br>
        dual stainless steel blades, and you have the Dimebucker. Huge and straight from the brain of the<br>
        late great Darrell Abbot. In a 2004 interview Dimebag described the tone of the Dimebucker, “Its<br>
        very saturated not to the point where its overly fuzzy but it has a smooth and crunchy distortion<br>
        tone. It will give you some extra gain, but it wont go so far that your sound breaks up and is going<br>
        crazy. You get that warm tone with the distortion mixed in and it has the low end thats kicking <br>
        you in the butt while the top end is cutting your face off in the right way, but not ripping your<br>
        face off. If you ever listen to a Pantera record, that’s what you’ll hear through this pickup”. Combine<br>
        with a 59 Model (bridge) in the neck position for the setup that Darrell himself used, or get our<br>
        Dimebag Set for neck and bridge. Hand built in Santa Barbara, CA, the Dimebucker uses a ceramic bar<br>
        magnet, dual stainless steel blades, 4-conductor lead wire for multiple wiring options, and is <br>
        vacuum wax potted for squeal-free performance.<br>

        Put mine in my Schecter Omen-6. I tune to E, or maybe a step down. Use 9 gauge D'Addario NYXL<br>
        strings. It suits metal just fine. You can't really appreciate it until you tweak with you amp<br>
        settings, then you can really bring out some awesome sounds out of it. Its very bright, squeals<br>
        are easy as hell with it. Really cuts through. Though without the tweaking, can be really thin.<br>
        Treble bleed mod was awesome for it. Don't really feel it applies to other genres easily (this is<br>
        where the treble bleed helps out). Leads slice right through, Van Halen is fun as hell to play with<br>
        this pup. You won't sound like Dimebag unless you got the rest of the gear. For people like me who<br>
        tend to like brighter pickups, and listen to any older metal, you'll be pretty satisfied.<br>
